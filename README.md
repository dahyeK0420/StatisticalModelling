# Predicting Fuel Efficiency - Regression Modelling
This program predicts fuel efficiency of a car (in km/L) based on its characteristics. Since Australia is one of the largest automobile markets in the world, correctly predicting the fuel efficiency is necessary to control emission rate to the environment.

Following datasets are used for the predictive analysis:

* **RegressionTrain.csv**: contains observations and predictors obtained from many retailers for car models available for sale from 2017 to 2020. The target variable is the fuel efficiency in km/L. The higher this value, the better the fuel efficiency of the car.
* **RegressionTest.csv**: contains the test data sets and the predicted values from the model built in statsmodelling.rmd
